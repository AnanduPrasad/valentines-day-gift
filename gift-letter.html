                    <p>Hello Ammu,</p>

                    <p>I don’t know how you did it… but you became my favorite notification of the day 😌</p>
                    
                    <p>You make everything feel easy, real, and just.. right.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for being my person, the one I can be completely myself with no filters. </p>

                    <p>I can’t wait to hold your hand through every season of life, laughing, loving, and figuring it all out together.</p>

                    <p>Finally, thanks for putting up with my chaos, my overthinking, and my occasional weirdness 😄</p>

                    <p>I may not say this as often as I should, but I love you. So much. More than my words usually manage to show.</p>

                    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</p>
