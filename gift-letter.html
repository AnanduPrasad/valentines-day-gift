                    <p>My Dearest Ammu,</p>

                    <p>As I sit here thinking about you, I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for having you in my life. You are not just my partner, but my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest blessing.</p>

                    <p>Every moment spent with you feels like a beautiful dream. Your laughter is the sweetest melody I've ever heard, and your smile brightens even my darkest days. The way you care for me, understand me, and love me makes me feel like the luckiest person alive.</p>

                    <p>You have taught me what true love means. It's in the little things - the way you hold my hand, the way you listen to my stories, the way you make everything better just by being there. With you, I've found a home, not in a place, but in a person.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for choosing me every single day. Thank you for your patience, your kindness, and your unconditional love. I promise to cherish you, support you, and love you with all my heart, today and always.</p>

                    <p>No words can truly express how much you mean to me, but I hope this letter shows you a glimpse of what's in my heart. You are my forever, my always, my everything.</p>

                    <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my love. Here's to us and to many more beautiful moments together.</p>

                        Forever yours,<br>
                        With all my love ❤️
